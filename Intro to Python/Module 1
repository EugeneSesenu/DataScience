Hello, My name is Eugene Sesenu. I am a senior at the University of Connecticut studying applied Mathematics. I started designing using html and css at the age of 15 and have an internship in a computational design analytics after i graduate.
I think of Data Science as using algorithms to reconstruct data into a structured or unstructured form so it's easily accessible to clients. I plan to incorporate data science into my life to make my life easier by budgeting things like things like buying groceries and daily living utilites
