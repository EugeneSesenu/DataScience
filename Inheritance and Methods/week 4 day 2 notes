Classes definition starts with the class statement






Class MyClass(Object):

"This initializes an instance of type ClassName”
def _init__(self, param1, param2):
    self.b = param1         #creates an instance attribute
    c = param2               #creates a local variable of the function
    
    
    
 def f(self, param1):
      #some statements
      a = 1 #This creates a class attribute
  
The method is the attribute within the class 
The instance helps create the characteristic of the object 
The parameter is used in methods in classes to give a method a characteristic
The __init__ method is a special method that is used in classes 
The first parameter self is used as the first parameter always in classes and methods as such 


Class MyClass:
    Variable = “blah”

     def function(self):
             print(“This is a message inside the class.”)

Myobjectx = MyClass(objectx) 
print(Myobjectx)


The case of super()__init() which is used to call a parent function inside of a subclass of another function
